                Background
            </h5>
            <p>
                I participate in math with a philosophical disposition. No other human practice transcends natural language and time quite like math does.

            <p>
                About a year after graduating from college (University of Delaware '15, B.Sc. Plant Science), I took Calc I at Harvard Extension school. I wanted to remind myself what it felt like to be a student, and to see how I had changed as a learner after being out of school for a time. Exploring math without the typical academic pressures of grades and course-requirements allowed me to relax and see the subject in a totally new light.
            </p>

            <p>
                Math can feel cold and 'inhuman,' but it doesn't have to. Taking another lap on Calc I about 6 years afer first seeing the material in high school, I had tons of fun re-learning the reasoning behind the chain rule, producing handfuls of eraser dust on problem sets, and asking what we can discern about a function based on its second derivarive. I had the time and space to ponder what a derivative really <i>is</i>--a philosophical question with a very 'human' history.
            </p>

            <p>
                Mathematical notation and abstract concepts are difficult. And potentially off-putting, especially if presented without care for each other. But by definition, math is made to be understood without misconception. We build it together, as humans, over time. It belongs to all of us.
            </p>

                I taught courses in high school Geometry, Algebra, and Pre-Calculus in Brookline MA (2017 - 2020).

                </a> (and his eponymous text) offer great material for a second course on Linear Algebra. I got a lot out of Axler's treatment of linear transformations as abstract mappings, saving matrices for a little later in the material.
